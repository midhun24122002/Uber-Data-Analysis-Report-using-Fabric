Project Workflow

1. Data Engineering Phase

Data Loading & Transformation:
Loaded data from multiple formats: HTML, XML, JSON, CSVs.
Used Azure Data Factory pipelines and Dataflow Gen2 for ETL processes.
Created 5 Dataflows to transform and clean the data for further use.
Data Ingestion:

Integrated data from Data Lakehouse into Data Warehouse.
Configured pipelines and dataflows to move data into destination warehouse tables.

2. Data Analysis & Reporting Phase

Data Import & Optimization:
Imported data into Power BI Desktop from the Data Warehouse.

Created optimized tables:
Rides_OLAP_Analysis
Date Table
Used Power Query for data transformation and DAX functions for advanced calculations.
